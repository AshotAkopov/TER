# TER
This repository contains the work carried out during my Research Project (Travail d'Étude et de Recherche – TER) as part of my Master’s program.

# Context
This work is largely based on the article Meta-Analytics: Tools for Understanding the Statistical Properties of Sports Metrics by Franks et al. (2016). The aim was to build on the authors' rigorous work, to understand it thoroughly, and to gain a practical command of it.
